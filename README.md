# FizzBuzzKata
Code for the FizzBuzz kata with python

- Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz"
  instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both
  three and five print "FizzBuzz".

- Adding feature of FizzBuzz variations (From http://agilekatas.co.uk/katas/FizzBuzz-Kata )
  Turns out that Fizz Buzz has a whole bunch of variants that people play in different countries and for different ages of children. One of the most interesting we have seen is Fizz Buzz Pop, where the word 'pop' is substituted for numbers that are a multiple of seven. We want you to extend the rules of our current Fizz Buzz game to allow players to play Fizz Buzz Pop instead.

- Adding feature of Creating Fizz Buzz Variations (From http://agilekatas.co.uk/katas/FizzBuzz-Kata )
  So not that many people have actually heard of or played Fizz Buzz Pop, probably because the substitution words are different in different countries across the world. We're going to give players the ability to create their own substitution words and link them to multiples of certain numbers, and we need you to make this possible.
